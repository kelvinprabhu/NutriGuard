      "\n",
      "4.  **Toast for Flavor:** Spread the mixture in a single, even layer on the prepared baking sheet. It's important not to overcrowd the pan to ensure even toasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. Stir the mixture halfway through (at the 5-6 minute mark) to prevent burning. The nuts are done when they are lightly golden and you can smell a fragrant, toasty aroma.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Cool Completely:** Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the mixture cool completely on the pan. The nuts and seeds will become crunchier as they cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Add Final Ingredients:** Once completely cool, transfer the toasted mixture back into your mixing bowl. Add the chia seeds and ground flaxseed. Stir well to combine. (These smaller seeds are added after baking to protect their delicate omega-3 fatty acids from high heat).\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Store:** Transfer the finished mix into an airtight container. Store at room temperature for up to two weeks.\n",
