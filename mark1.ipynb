      "\n",
      "This plan is designed to stabilize blood sugar levels, provide sustained energy, and ensure adequate nutrition. It incorporates principles of the diabetic diet, focusing on complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats, and high fiber, with a cultural consideration for Indian cuisine.\n",

      "### **Dietary Plan for Aarav Mehta**\n",
      "**Patient:** Aarav Mehta, 29, Male\n",
      "**Condition:** Type 2 Diabetes\n",
      "**Admission Date:** November 03, 2025\n",
      "**Restrictions:** Low Sugar, No Sweets\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Principles of this Meal Plan:**\n",
      "*   **Glycemic Control:** Foods are chosen for their low glycemic index (GI) to prevent sharp spikes in blood sugar.\n",
      "*   **Portion Control:** Serving sizes are key to managing calorie and carbohydrate intake.\n",
      "*   **Nutrient Density:** Emphasizes whole foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n",
      "*   **Regular Meals:** Eating at regular intervals helps maintain stable glucose levels.\n",
      "*   **Hydration:** Water is essential and should be consumed throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Suggested One-Day Meal Plan**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early Morning (6:30 AM - 7:00 AM)**\n",
      "*   **Drink:** 1 glass of warm water with a teaspoon of soaked fenugreek (methi) seeds or a pinch of cinnamon powder.\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* Fenugreek and cinnamon are known to help improve insulin sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Breakfast (8:00 AM - 8:30 AM)**\n",
      "*   **Option 1:** 2 medium-sized **Moong Dal Chillas** (savory lentil crepes) with green chutney (no sugar). Served with 1 bowl of plain, low-fat curd (yogurt).\n",
      "*   **Option 2:** 1 bowl of **Vegetable Masala Oats**. Made with rolled oats, finely chopped vegetables (carrots, peas, beans), and mild spices. Avoid instant oats with added sugar.\n",
      "*   **Option 3:** 2 small **Ragi (Finger Millet) Dosas** with a small bowl of sambar (lentil and vegetable stew).\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* These options are high in protein and fiber, providing a slow release of energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mid-Morning Snack (11:00 AM)**\n",
      "*   **Option 1:** 1 small apple or pear with the skin on.\n",
      "*   **Option 2:** A handful of nuts (approx. 5-6 almonds and 2-3 walnuts).\n",
      "*   **Option 3:** 1 glass of unsweetened buttermilk (chaas) with roasted cumin powder.\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* A small, fiber-rich snack prevents overeating at lunch and keeps blood sugar stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lunch (1:00 PM - 1:30 PM)**\n",
      "*   **A balanced thali-style meal:**\n",
      "    *   **Carbohydrates:** 2 small multigrain or whole wheat rotis (phulka). (Avoid naan or white bread).\n",
      "    *   **Protein:** 1 medium bowl of **Dal Tadka** or **Mixed Sprout Curry**.\n",
      "    *   **Vegetables:** 1 medium bowl of a non-starchy vegetable dish (sabzi) like **Bhindi Masala** (okra), **Lauki Sabzi** (bottle gourd), or **Mixed Vegetable Curry** (cauliflower, beans, carrots). Use minimal oil.\n",
      "    *   **Salad:** A generous portion of fresh salad (cucumber, tomato, onion, lettuce) with a squeeze of lemon juice.\n",
      "    *   **Dairy:** 1 small bowl of plain low-fat curd or raita (with cucumber or mint, no boondi).\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* This combination provides a balanced mix of all macronutrients, with high fiber from the salad and vegetables slowing down carbohydrate absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evening Snack (4:30 PM - 5:00 PM)**\n",
      "*   **Option 1:** 1 bowl of roasted **Makhana** (fox nuts) with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n",
      "*   **Option 2:** 1 cup of green tea (unsweetened) with a small bowl of **Sprouts Chaat** (mixed sprouts with chopped onion, tomato, and lemon juice).\n",
      "*   **Option 3:** A small bowl of boiled black chickpeas (kala chana).\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* A light, protein-rich snack to manage hunger and energy levels before dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dinner (7:30 PM - 8:00 PM)**\n",
      "*   **Keep dinner light and easy to digest.**\n",
      "*   **Option 1:** 1 bowl of **Vegetable Quinoa Pulao** or **Brown Rice Khichdi** with a side of steamed vegetables.\n",
      "*   **Option 2:** **Grilled Paneer or Chicken Tikka** (100g) with a large portion of sautéed green vegetables (broccoli, bell peppers, spinach).\n",
      "*   **Option 3:** 1 large bowl of **Mixed Vegetable and Lentil Soup** with 1 small multigrain roti.\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* A lighter carbohydrate load in the evening helps prevent high morning blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bedtime (Optional, if needed - 9:30 PM)**\n",
      "*   **Drink:** 1 glass of warm milk (low-fat) with a pinch of turmeric. No sugar.\n",
      "    *   *Rationale:* This can help prevent overnight hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and promote better sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "### **Important General Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Hydration:** Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water throughout the day. Avoid fruit juices, sodas, and other sugary drinks.\n",
      "2.  **Cooking Methods:** Prioritize steaming, grilling, baking, and stir-frying over deep-frying. Use minimal oil (e.g., mustard oil, rice bran oil, or olive oil).\n",
      "3.  **Foods to Strictly Avoid:**\n",
      "    *   All forms of sugar, jaggery, honey, and sweets (mithai).\n",
      "    *   Refined flour products (white bread, maida, pasta).\n",
      "    *   Fried foods (samosas, pakoras).\n",
      "    *   High-sugar fruits like mangoes, grapes, and bananas (or consume in very limited, controlled portions).\n",
      "    *   Processed and packaged foods, which often contain hidden sugars.\n",
      "4.  **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels as advised by the physician is crucial to see how the body is responding to this diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disclaimer:** This is a general dietary suggestion. It is highly recommended that this plan be reviewed and personalized by a registered dietitian or the patient's primary care physician to align with his specific caloric needs, activity level, and medical profile.\n"
